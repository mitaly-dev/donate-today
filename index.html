            <h3>Food for a family</h3>
            <p>
              We think that the most important thing for survival is food. And
              at this time, the people affected by the floods stay away from
              cooking a little, they can't even go to the shops to buy food. So
              we have decided to take care of the food of a few hundred families
              so that they do not go hungry.

            <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
            <p>
              Thousands of families have lost their homes in the flood
              situation. Their homes have been washed away. They have now taken
              shelter and there is no place for them to go to the shelter.
              Although the flood situation is normal, there is no home for them
              to go. So we will make arrangements for their accommodation.

              At this time they can get sick at any time because there is no
              pure water available, if anyone consumes that water then various
              diseases can occur. Besides, there are these colds. Those who
              choose adults may need emergency medicine

              These helpless people are staring at us, if we can't do anything
